## Description

**Meta Box is a powerful, professional, and lightweight toolkit for developers to create unlimited custom meta boxes and WordPress custom fields.**

Meta Box helps you add [custom fields](https://metabox.io) and details on your website such as pages, posts, forms and anywhere you want using over 40 different field types such as text, images, file upload, checkboxes, and more.

On top of that, each WordPress custom field type has extensive internal options for unlimited content possibilities. Complete customization and control is just a few clicks away.

Adding WordPress custom fields and custom meta boxes is quick and painless: Select the field types you want in the user-friendly [Online Generator](https://metabox.io/online-generator/), then copy and paste the code into your child theme's `functions.php` file.

**Boom! All the power with none of the bloat.**

There are also free and premium extensions available to add enhanced capabilities. You can manage the display and organization of your WordPress custom fields, the conditions upon which they appear, and become the ultimate WordPress data wizard.

You can also check out the [full list of extensions](https://metabox.io/plugins/) and [MetaBox.io](https://metabox.io) for details.
